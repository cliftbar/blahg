## Notes as I learn the boat
- Trimmer
    - cross sheet with the Genoa blocks
    - Blow the Genoa early compared to the Jib
- Main:
    - curl the top leach tale. Curling the second is pinching
    - Backstay before traveler to depower
    - boom can go past centerline if there's enough flow, but be careful with that, not sustainable 
- Spin:
    - play the shoulder curl aggressively
    - let Pit take the guy early, so Trimmer can play the curl
Helm:
    - take shifts while the trimmer can keep up
    - short course WL, prefer the inside and/or gybe around the windward mark for control. 
    - Sail flat. Sail flat. Sail flat.
