## Service List
Most services are running on Nomad, but some are just directly installed on the server.

- [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/)
    - Container Orchestration
    - Rating: 2/5; it's just user unfriendly enough to be bad for a home server, and has much less online presence for solving issues.  Unfortunately I think Docker Compose + Swarm or Kubernetes would ultimately be easier to manage.  Nomad was a fun experiment, I like the concept of less batteries included, but I wouldn't do it again.
- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)
    - Static/Templated Sites and Reverse Proxy
    - Rating: 5/5; does everything I need with fairly easy configuration, nice after coming from HAProxy and Nginix.
- [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/)
    - Movies and Shows
    - Installed
    - Rating: 4/5; it has some minor things I don't like, but in the end I haven't been affected by most of the more controversial issues and it has done the job well.
- [Photoprism](https://www.photoprism.app/)
    - Google Photos Replacement
    - Rating: 3/5; it's missing some features I'd like, especially multi-library per user support, but it does well enough as a bucket for photos.
- [AudioBookShelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/)
    - Audiobook and Podcast hosting
    - Rating: 4/5; It's a bit rough around the edges, but has been doing well all things considered.
- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)
    - EBook Management
    - Installed
    - Rating: 5/5; It's hard to give it anything less, despite a ... less than modern UX, since this is one of the oldest self-host services I have while also being one of the most hands off - it just chugs along.
- [ddclient](https://ddclient.net/)
    - DNS updates to keep domain name records correct
    - Rating: 4/5; does the thing easily now that I've set it up, despite going through a maintainer change that slowed development.
- [Vector](https://vector.dev/), [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/)
    - Log collection and monitoring
    - Vector: metric collection
    - Loki: Log aggregation
    - Grafana: Visualization
    - Rating: 3/5; This stack took alot of setup and research, and I'd like it to be simpler, but it's working fine.
- [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
    - File syncronization across devices
    - Installed
    - Rating: 5/5; I haven't missed cloud storage for file sync at all
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
    - Database
    - Rating: 4/5; sure does do database things.
- [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/)
    - GitHub Replacement
    - Rating: Too new to rate, but seems ok so far
- [Odin Storm Builder](https://www.odinseye.cloud/)
    - Model footprint builder for Odin's Eye
    - This used to be in GCP, but I pulled it back to self-host
    - Rating: 4/5; self hosting this is much easier
- [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/)
    - VPN
    - Installed on Router
    - Rating: 4/5; setup could be easier, and there's a couple configurations I still haven't been able to do properly, but it has been solid.
- [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/)
    - Disk backup
    - Rating: 4/5; does backup things

## Things to Try
- [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/) (object storage)
- Kubernetes flavor (orchestration)
- [Plausible](https://github.com/plausible/analytics) (website analytics)

## Rating Scale:
- 5: Rock solid, easy, would recommend, no (real) complaints
- 4: Some complaints, but good overall
- 3: Functions fine, but very meh personally for whatever reason
- 2: Would not recommend, would not do again
- 1: I need to replace this soon
