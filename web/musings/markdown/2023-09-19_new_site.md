Welcome to another attempt at a maintaining a site. I'll be trying to consolidate everything from my various other places here.

## Basic Structure
The core of the site is Caddy and it's templating engine.  Using some clever url rewriting and template code that I shamelessly copied from the Caddy documentation site itself, all requests for Posts are actually rendering the same html file. Posts are markdown files, which get injected into html body.  So it's almost nearly static-ish site, since there's still stuff happening server side each request.

## Easy and Simple
The point of all the above is to make creating new content as easy as possible. Posts don't require any work besides creating  (or updating) a markdown file, after that it's automatically picked up.  No build steps or messing with infra pieces. And the markdown files are synced across all my devices with Syncthing.  Behind the scenes, I've got the site running as just one sub-piece of a Caddy deployment on Nomad running a bunch of sites and reverse-proxies.

## Let's see if it works
Hopefully I can stick to actually updating the site regularly. And continue building out some features, so I can say I made a blog site for myself too.  At some point I should give this site a load test, and decide if I'm sticking with Nomad.
