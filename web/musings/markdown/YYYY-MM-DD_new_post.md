tl;dr: Adding flexibility affects who pays the cost of Complexity, generally by pushing the payment downstream.

Complexity is a cost that has a bad habit of being conserved [1].  I've found it rare that anything truly removes complexity from a system, generally it's just moved around, changing who pays for it.  Don't get me wrong, this is very powerful, I'm very happy that, for example I don't need to fully understand the modern web from the ground up.  Smarter and more dedicated people than me took most of that complexity, nicely packaged it up, and made it so all I need to do is import Requests and Flask to get going.  All the complexity still exists, but its well hidden; the developers of Flask have paid most of this Complexity cost at design time.

However, there does seem to be infinite ways of adding Complexity to a System, paradoxical as that sounds: Complexity is conserved, but also easy to increase?  One lens for solving this paradox is that perhaps its not that Complexity is being created out of no where, but that the System itself is changing.  So, after some rephrasing: its much easier to make a Complex System than a Simple System.  That sounds better
