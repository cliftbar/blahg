## Stores
- [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/)
    - hard to find the right items, but the items are cheaper.
- [Retro Game Repair Shop](https://retrogamerepairshop.com/) (RGRS)
    - A reseller site, but decent experiences so far.
- [Funny Playing](https://funnyplaying.com/)
    - Decent for more costly parts, but they also focus more on their first party products
- [Handheld Legends](https://handheldlegend.com/)
    - Has the largest selection (though it doesn't overlap that much with RGRS), and is probably the goto for customization, but hard to navigate

## Gameboy Color parts list

### Build Types
- Basic Build
    - This is really just replacing the screen with a new backlit one.  Everything else is the same, plus or minus replacement parts to fix anything broken.
    - Cost ~$90
        - GBC ~$50: assuming getting a broken one and fixing it.
        - 2.4" Replacement Screen ~$40: A fairly basic backlit screen that fits into the original shell.  It's slightly smaller than the OEM screen, but not by much.
- Fancy build
    - This is a more involved build: a bigger screen with more features and a rechargable battery
    - Cost ~$150
    - GBC ~$50: assuming getting a broken one and fixing it.
    - Power Mod ~$45: This is a new power circuit for a rechargable battery.  Required for the larger screen.
    - 2.6" IPS Screen Kit ~$55: Kit comes with the screen and a shell.  Original shells can be modified for the 2.6" screen, but it really isn't worth it, just buy a new matching shell.
- Extra Costs: Doing any more involved customization as far as colors and such will start adding costs in materials, as will more replacement parts.
