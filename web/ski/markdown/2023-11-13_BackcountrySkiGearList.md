# Pack for the day
Not everything comes every day, I make adjustments at the car for how long I'll be out, weather conditions, etc. For the most part packing lighter, moving faster, and calling the day early is a better defense than needing emergency gear, so there is a balance. 

# Sharing
While all this does fit into the pack, a group can share some of this gear between people, like the first aid kit, stove, or tools bag.

# Wall of Shame
- Monocular: [ECHO Pocket](https://www.brunton.com/products/echo-pocket-scope)
    - I dropped this in the parking lot, and _every_ internal piece came detached.  Destroyed instantly.
