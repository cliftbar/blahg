## Packing for the day
Not everything comes every day, I make adjustments at the car for how long I'll be out, weather conditions, etc. For the most part packing lighter, moving faster, and calling the day early is a better defense than needing emergency gear, so there is a balance.

# Wall of Shame
- Monocular: [ECHO Pocket](https://www.brunton.com/products/echo-pocket-scope)
    - I dropped this in the parking lot, and _every_ internal piece came detached.  Destroyed instantly.

# Update Spring 2024
It's the end of the season! Sort of, Mt. Hood is never really done, glacier, but the main ski season is over.  So it's time to review what actually ended up in my pack and update the gear list.  Mostly stuff got tossed out by being overkill or unused, it is nicer to not carry dead weight.  And then I promptly added more mountaineering gear to start heading further up Mt. Hood and the glaciers.
