## 2023-11-26: Another easy practice day
### Summary
Much the same as the 22nd, though less coverage after 4 days of sun warming.  There was no cloud layer this time, so the views were really good.  Trillium lake and Ski Bowl were visible from where I was, as was what I think is Mt. Jefferson off in the distance.

### Conditions
~35°F, clear skies, low wind.  Sun warmed snow, losing coverage.  Hopefully Hood gets more snow soon, the next forecasted is in about 4 days

### Report
No gear issues, and no real boot problems.

## 2023-11-22: Day 1
### Summary
This was a good gear shakedown and practice day. Minus a couple minor issues, everything important worked well. The main problem was my lack of cardio over the summer. The conditions turned out better than I expected in the end, since I was above the cloud layer things were mostly clear and the slope was skiable for being early season.

### The Plan
Park at the Salmon River lot at Timberline, test out all my gear with a short uphill and back.

### Conditions
~40°F, clear skies (above the cloud layer), low wind.

The main uphill approach at Timberline still doesn't have much snow.  However, there's a line up slightly inside the resort boundary that has plenty enough to practice skinning and get some gentle turns in until Timberline opens.  Just keep any eye out for rocks, I skipped off two on the way down.

### Report
The gear failures were minor but annoying. The first failure was about 1 minutes after parking: I dropped my monocle, and all the internal optics pieces broke loose. It was cheap, but I didn't think it would be that bad; it's now the first piece of gear on the [Wall of Shame](https://cliftbar.site/ski/2023-11-13_BackcountrySkiGearList.html#wall-of-shame).  The second failure was the basket falling off my pole. The baskets they came with were unscrewing the whole day, so I'm not surprised. I've replaced them with better fitting ones, so that should be solved now.

Otherwise, besides being unsurprisingly out of shape for uphill, everything worked out well. I do think I'll look into a 40L pack at some point, as opposed to my 30L one. Fully loaded there isn't much space left, and getting to things is a bit annoying.  But I was carrying more than I usual will for a day trip, so that's not a problem for now.
