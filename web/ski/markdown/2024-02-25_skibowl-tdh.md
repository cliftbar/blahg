This is primarily for Tom Dick and Harry Mountain (TDH), though since Ski Bowl is an exit for touring TDH it'll get some attention also.  Plus Ski Bowl (SB) at night is cool. 

## Tom Dick and Harry Mountain (TDH)
There, that's the last time I need to write the whole name.  TDH has the distinction of being the (technically) closest touring area to Portland (citation needed). Unfortunately, it's also low, with a trailhead at about 3,600' and a peak of 5,000', so snow conditions can ofter be spotty, similar to Ski Bowl. There's only so much you can get done in the 4,000s. SB provides a handy exit at the end of the day, or a chance to stay on the slopes once the light starts to fade. 

I haven't skied TDH yet, only hiked up to the point where the route turns off the main trail just beyond Mirror Lake (which is a good destination for an easier hike).

Today was a scouting mission, since I was unsure of the route up. As far as I can tell, the trailhead was moved in the past few years, making the first steps of most route guides I've found out of date. That said, the current path is straightforward: Park at the trail head, follow the Mirror Lake Trail until just past the lake, then cut off the trail up a ridgeline. The trail has lots of people on it, packing down the snow, so there's a decent chance skinning won't be the fastest travel method until after the lake. Not to mention there might be no snow in some lower sections. Plan to boot pack for a bit. 

## Mt. Hood Ski Bowl
A smaller resort across the highway from Mt. Hood, Ski Bowl (SB) is a locals spot.  On paper it's lacking compared to other options: It has little in the way of amenities and attractions for people who don't want to play in the snow, is the only place I've seen with single speed 2 person chairs in a while, and a low elevation means it's prone to rain and bad conditions.  But in practice, SB has some really excellent terrain, is relatively inexpensive, and has probably the best night skiing I've ever seen.
